## Our vision

The [OKP4] Design System is a collection of clear guidelines, components, and resources that was created to aid in the design and development of our digital products - primarily our web apps or websites - for our customers.

The OKP4 Design System serves as a reference or source of truth for the teams working on [OKP4] digital products, enabling to design and develop with speed, consistency, and quality.

## Get started

The OKP4 Design System contains a collection of [React](https://reactjs.org) components that can be used to build accessible and performant React applications consistent with [OKP4] brand guidelines.

### Build

```sh
yarn
```

üöÄ Start Storybook and üë®‚Äçüíª start editing.

## Contributing

So you want to contribute? Great. We appreciate any help you're willing to give. Don't hesitate to open issues and/or submit pull requests.

Remember that this is the Design System we use at [OKP4](https://github.com/okp4). This is why we may have to refuse change requests simply because they do not comply with our internal requirements, and not because they are not relevant.
