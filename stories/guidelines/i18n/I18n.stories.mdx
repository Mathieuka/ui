# Internationalization

## Description

OKP4 design system provides an internationalization service (i18n) that allows to change the text inside components
and to support different languages or easily customize strings inside the web component.

The components exposed by the library already have their own translations, which allows them to be used without any additional configuration.  
However, it is quite possible for the user of our library to dynamically add their own files and translation keys in order,
either to enhance the basic translations, or to create translations for high-level elements
like a web page for example without having to configure a new i18n instance.

## Language detection

Our internationalization system is based on advanced user language detection.
Indeed, there are multiple ways to determine the language used in order to be able to load the correct translations.
So, we use in order:

### URL parameter (query string parameter)

It is possible to add a query string parameter in the url which responds to the following format:

```
https://my-awesome-webapp.com/home/?lng=EN
```

The handling of the `lng` parameter will generate a refresh of the i18n keys according to the language passed as query string parameter.

### Local storage

Each time the i18n instance is created or updated, a search in the local storage of the browser is carried out in order
to retrieve a possible key whose value bears the user language:

```
i18nextLng=LANGUAGE
```

It is thus quite possible to update this value according to a user interaction and to force a refresh of the translations and i18n keys.
For example:

```typescript
import i18n from '@okp4/ui'

const updateLanguage = (user: { name: string; language: string }): void => {
  const previousLanguage = localStorage.getItem('i18nextLng')
  localStorage.setItem('i18nextLng', user.language)
  if (previousLanguage && previousLanguage !== user.language) {
    i18n.changeLanguage(user.language)
  }
}
```

### Browser

If none of the previous detection elements have made it possible to recover the user language, the internationalization
system will automatically recover the language of the browser in which the instance was launched and save it as the usual language,
which will thus allow show translations in this language.  
 There is no particular manipulation to operate to activate detection by browser language, this is done automatically.

## Usage

### Load dynamic translations

The internationalization system offered by OKP4 allows you to dynamically add translation files that can be used in any React component contained in the webapp.

> **_NOTE:_** The merging behavior of translation resources follows the principle of extension and not overwriting.
> If the given file targets an existing namespace, it will not be overwritten but the keys of multiple files will be merged.

To do this, just use the `loadTranslations` method at the top level of the application witch accepts an array of translations as parameter.
The given parameter must implement the following type:

```typescript
type I18nResource = Readonly<{
  readonly lng: string
  readonly namespace: string
  readonly resource: JSONValue //the JSON file itself
}>
```

##### **`main.ts`**

```typescript
import { loadTranslations } from "@okp4/ui"
import type { I18nResource } from "@okp4/ui"
import example1_en from './example1_en.json
import example1_fr from './example1_fr.json

const translationsToLoad : I18nResource[] = [
  {lng: "EN", namespace: "example1", resource: example1_en},
  {lng: "FR", namespace: "example1", resource: example1_fr}
]

loadTranslations(translationsToLoad)
```

### Translation service

Once the translations have been added dynamically, it is possible to directly use the built-in `useTranslate` hook in the component:

##### **`helloWorld.tsx`**

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import { useTranslation } from '@okp4/ui'

export const MyComponent: React.FC = () => {
  const { t, i18n } = useTranslation()
  return <p>{t('example1:common.hello.title')}</p>
}
```

The `t` function accepts the translation key as parameter that could be prefixed by the namespace containing the key to translate.
The `namespace` could also be passed as parameter to the `useTranslation` function if all the keys to be translated into the component
belong to the same namespace.
