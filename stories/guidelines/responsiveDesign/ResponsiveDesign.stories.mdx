# Responsive web design

## Description

Responsive web design is a concept that emerged from the need to adapt web sites to different viewport sizes as device screen
sizes became more divers. The concept entails a set of practices to allow web pages to adapt its layout and appearance to different
screen resolutions, width etc.

### Responsive design techniques

Responsive web design uses three principal techniques to render a page responsive :

- **Fluid grids :** Grid layouts gives designers a rational, structured framework for organizing content and users a well-organized, easily-readable site.

- **Fluid images :** Setting images to `max-width: 100%` makes them scale down if the container column is smaller than the intrinsic size of the image,
  all while preventing the images from growing larger if the width of the column increases.

- **Media queries :** CSS media queries allows to change the grid layout by function of the width of the viewport. By setting breakpoints we tell the
  DOM how we want the content to render for specific viewport sizes.

### ØKP4 responsive design

**ØKP4** components have 5 set breakpoints: `isXSmall`, `isSmall`, `isMedium`, `isLarge` and `isXLarge` that will return true if their
media queries match the min- and max-width of the viewport.

```ts
import { useMediaType } from './useMediaType'

export type Breakpoints = {
  isXSmall: boolean
  isSmall: boolean
  isMedium: boolean
  isLarge: boolean
  isXLarge: boolean
}

export const useBreakpoint = (): Breakpoints => ({
  isXSmall: useMediaType('(max-width: 480px)'), // Mobile device.
  isSmall: useMediaType('(min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 768px)'), // Tablette device.
  isMedium: useMediaType('(min-width: 769px) and (max-width: 1024px)'), // Small laptop screen.
  isLarge: useMediaType('(min-width: 1025px) and (max-width: 1200px)'), // desktop large screen.
  isXLarge: useMediaType('(min-width: 1201px)') // Extra large screens.
})
```

## Usage

To use the **ØKP4 responsive design**, import the `useBreakpoint` hook and the `Breakpoints` type in your file and declare
the breakingpoints that you want to use.

```tsx
import type { Breakpoints } from 'hook/useBreakpoint'
import { useBreakpoint } from 'hook/useBreakpoint'

const { isXSmall }: Breakpoints = useBreakpoint()
```
