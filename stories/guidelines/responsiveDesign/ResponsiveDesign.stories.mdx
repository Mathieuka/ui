# Responsive web design

## Description

Responsive web design is a concept that emerged from the need to adapt web sites to different viewport sizes as device screen
sizes became more divers. The concept entails a set of practices to allow web pages to adapt its layout and appearance to different
screen resolutions, width etc.

### Responsive design techniques

Responsive web design uses three principal techniques to render a page responsive :

- **Fluid grids :** Grid layouts gives designers a rational, structured framework for organizing content and users a well-organized, easily-readable site.

- **Fluid images :** Setting images to `max-width: 100%` makes them scale down if the container column is smaller than the intrinsic size of the image,
  while preventing the images from growing larger if the width of the column increases.

- **Media queries :** CSS media queries allows to change the grid layout by function of the width of the viewport. By setting breakpoints we tell the
  DOM how we want the content to render for specific viewport sizes.

### ØKP4 responsive design

**ØKP4** design system relies on 5 main breakpoints:

- **`XSmall - (max-width: 480px)`** for a mobile phone screen.
- **`Small - (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 768px)`** for a tablet screen.
- **`Medium - (min-width: 769px) and (max-width: 1024px)`** for a small laptop screen.
- **`Large - (min-width: 1025px) and (max-width: 1200px)`** for a large desktop screen.
- **`XLarge - (min-width: 1201px)`** for large screens like TV's.

These breakpoints make it possible to adapt each component to the size of the screen used, which considerably enriches the User eXperience as well as the ability to navigate in a fluid environment.

## Usage

To use the **ØKP4 responsive design** in your React component, just import the `useBreakpoint` hook and the `Breakpoints` type in your file and declare
the breakpoints you want to use.

##### **`example.tsx`**

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import type { Breakpoints } from '@okp4/ui'
import { useBreakpoint } from '@okp4/ui'

export const Example: React.FC = () => {
  const { isXSmall }: Breakpoints = useBreakpoint()
  return (
    <div>
      <img
        alt="example"
        src="./myExampleImage.png"
        style={{ width: isXSmall ? '100px' : '100%' }}
      />
    </div>
  )
}
```
