/**
* This is a hack to prevent Firefox to render story with a tiny height.
* When storybook's features.modernInlineRender is enabled, a 70px height is set for story container,
* instead of using automatic height, only in Firefox.
* These lines of code below intercept the height from the container and force it to be in auto mode.
* /!\ TBD: check for future storybook versions and remove this code if issue is fixed /!\
