# Header component

[![stability-unstable](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-unstable-yellow.svg)](https://github.com/emersion/stability-badges#unstable)

## Description

**Header component** is a responsive component which embeds two main elements:

- A `Logo` which must be part of the set of applications representing the ØKP4 brand.
- A `ThemeSwitcher` which allows each application to automatically manage the themes offered by the ØKP4 design system (Blue Stone / Light Stone).

## Overview

<Story name="Overview">
  <div style={{ width: '100%' }}>
    <Header />
  </div>
</Story>

---

## Responsiveness

The component was built according to the principles of Responsive Web Design (see <a href="?path=/docs/guidelines-responsive-web-design--page">dedicated guideline</a> ) in particular thanks to the use of media queries and a responsive grid.
This allows the component to adapt to any screen size, from the smallest phone to a large desktop screen or television.

## Prerequisites

It is mandatory to wrap the component in a `<ThemeProvider />` for the `<ThemeSwitcher />` to work, like in the code snippet below.  
See <a href="?path=/docs/atoms-brand-identity-theming--theming">Theming</a> for more information.

##### **`app.tsx`**

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import { Header, ThemeProvider } from '@okp4/ui'

export const App: React.FC = () => (
  <React.StrictMode>
    <ThemeProvider>
      <Header />
    </ThemeProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>
)
```
