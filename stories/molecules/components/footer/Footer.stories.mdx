## Description

**Footer** is a responsive component which embeds two main elements:

- A `LanguageSwitcher` component that offers users the ability to change the language of the application.
- A `Typography` element which contains the link to the brand website and the brand name.

## Overview

<Story
  name="Overview"
  args={{
    brandHyperLink: 'https://okp4.network',
    brandName: 'Ã˜KP4'
  }}
>
  {args => (
    <div style={{ width: '100%' }}>
      <Footer {...args} />
    </div>
  )}
</Story>

---

### Properties

<ArgsTable story="Overview" />

## Responsiveness

The component was built according to the principles of Responsive Web Design (see <a href="?path=/docs/guidelines-responsive-web-design--page">dedicated guideline</a> ) in particular thanks to the use of media queries and a responsive grid.
This allows the component to adapt to any screen size, from the smallest phone to a large desktop screen or television.

## Prerequisites

It is mandatory to wrap the component in a `<ThemeProvider />` for the theming to work, like in the code snippet below.  
See <a href="?path=/docs/atoms-brand-identity-theming--theming">Theming</a> for more information.

##### **`app.tsx`**

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import { Footer } from '@okp4/ui'
import { ThemeProvider } from '@okp4/ui'

export const App: React.FC = () => (
  <React.StrictMode>
    <ThemeProvider>
      <Footer />
    </ThemeProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>
)
```
