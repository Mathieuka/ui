## Overview

### Description

`LanguageSwitcher` is used to offer multi-language support to users in order to improve their experience on the application.

It has no background color itself: it is proposed here with the background colors used by the footer.

It is originally intended to appear in the footer but can also be used in other places to give the user a free choice.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Overview">
    <div
      style={{
        display: 'flex',
        alignItems: 'center',
        justifyContent: 'center'
      }}
    >
      <LanguageSwitcher />
    </div>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Responsiveness

The component was built according to the principles of Responsive Web Design (see <a href="?path=/docs/guidelines-responsive-web-design--page">dedicated guideline</a> ) in particular thanks to the use of media queries and a responsive grid.
This allows the component to adapt to any screen size, from the smallest phone to a large desktop screen or television.

## Prerequisites

`LanguageSwitcher` is designed to be used on dark backgrounds because of its white text color.

## Notes

`LanguageSwitcher` currently offers a set of two languages: English and French.
It will be possible to add other languages at a later stage.
