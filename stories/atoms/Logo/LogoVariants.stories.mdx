## Variants

The logo comes with a property called `variant` which allows to directly use the standalone logo or to freely compose destructured logo's elements.

### Logo

The standalone logo, mainly designed to mark the visual identity of OKP4. Can be used in a header for example.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Logo"
    args={{
      variant: 'logo',
      theme: 'light',
      size: 'medium'
    }}
  >
    {args => (
      <div>
        <Logo {...args} />
      </div>
    )}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Logotype

Has an immediate visual impact on the perception of the company, can be used in particular in cards or as a favicon.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Logotype"
    args={{
      variant: 'logotype',
      theme: 'light',
      size: 'medium'
    }}
  >
    {args => (
      <div>
        <Logo {...args} />
      </div>
    )}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Logomark

Represents the OKP4 name in order to mark the membership and not to weigh down the interface by being smoothed with the elements of content.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Logomark"
    args={{
      variant: 'logomark',
      theme: 'light',
      size: 'medium'
    }}
  >
    {args => (
      <div>
        <Logo {...args} />
      </div>
    )}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Slogan

The slogan is used to add strength to OKP4 content, especially in terms of protocol usage. It can be used in presentation elements to assert the visual impact of the interface.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Slogan"
    args={{
      variant: 'slogan',
      theme: 'light',
      size: 'medium'
    }}
  >
    {args => (
      <div>
        <Logo {...args} />
      </div>
    )}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
