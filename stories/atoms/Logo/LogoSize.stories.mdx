## Sizes

The logo comes with threw different sizes to allow its use according to its location within the interface

### Small

Particularly suitable for small screens and must not saturate the space. This size should also be used for integrations in content spaces such as cards, footers, etc...

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Small"
    args={{
      variant: 'logo',
      theme: 'light',
      size: 'small'
    }}
  >
    {args => (
      <div>
        <Logo {...args} />
      </div>
    )}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Medium

This size makes it possible to adapt to a greater number of uses, both to represent the brand and to be used in content elements.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Medium"
    args={{
      variant: 'logo',
      theme: 'light',
      size: 'medium'
    }}
  >
    {args => (
      <div>
        <Logo {...args} />
      </div>
    )}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

    }}
