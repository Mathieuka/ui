## Description

    )
  ]}
>

    const { theme } = useTheme()
    return (
      <div className="theme-story-main">
        <ThemeSwitcher {...args} />

    )
  }}
</Story>

## Properties

<ArgsTable story="Theming" />

## Usage

OKP4 theming comes with a built-in UI `<ThemeSwitcher />` component, designed to be easily used in user interfaces.

### Prerequisites

Before any use of the `<ThemeSwitcher />` component, it is first mandatory to inject the OKP4 `<ThemeProvider/>` at the highest level in the application.
This will allow in particular to activate the reactivity linked to the theme change by the user.

##### **`main.ts`**

```tsx
<React.StrictMode>
  <ThemProvider>
    <App />
  <ThemeProvider>
</React.StrictMode>
```

### Theme Switcher

The `<ThemeSwitcher />` component can be invoked anywhere in your application.
As an example, you could insert it in your header component to display it near toolbar actions:

##### **`header.tsx`**

```tsx
<>
  <ThemeSwitcher />
  <Header />
  {...}
</>
```

### Utilities

OKP4 provides a `useTheme` hook which allows at any time in the application to retrieve the value of the `theme`.  
Optionally, you may also want to force its change by invoking the `setTheme` method which, currently, only takes `light | dark` as argument.

As an example, if you want to retrieve the theme value to inline style your component :

##### **`example.tsx`**

```tsx
import { useTheme } from '@okp4/ui'
import themes from '@okp4/ui/lib/scss/_exports.module.scss' // the theme object

export const MyExampleComponent: React.FC = ({ title }: string) => {
  const { theme, setTheme } = useTheme()
  return <div style={{ color: themes[`${theme}-highlighted-text`] }}>{title}</div>
}
```
