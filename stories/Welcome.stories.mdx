## What is it?

The OKP4 Design System is an open-source set of components and resources created to facilitate the design and development of web interfaces in the [OKP4](https://okp4.network) Ecosystem.

This design system serves as a fantastic tool for all those around the world who work on web3.0 digital products in the OKP4 Ecosystem in the first place, but more generally in the [Cosmos](https://cosmos.network) Ecosystem, and who wish to design and develop decentralized applications with speed, consistency, reliability and quality.

## The scope

The scope of the OKP4 Design System is very wide: from elementary components (buttons, cards, file input, text field, toast, typography, etc.) to more complex components addressing concrete and common Use Cases (token faucet, wallet management, [Cosmos](https://cosmos.network) blockchains exploration, etc.). 

> The project is still young, but the development is intensive. Stay tuned! üëÄ
